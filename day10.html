<p>Jai Shree Ram (Jaya Sri Rama) is an expression in Hindu language, which means “Glory to Lord Rama” or “Victory to Lord Rama”. The proclamation has been used as an informal greeting or as a symbol of adhering to Hindu faith or for projection of varied faith-centered emotions, by Hindus. Saying Jai Shri Ram was a common practice in ancient Bharat (India).</p>

<h1 id="Ram">Meaning of Jai Shri Ram</h1>
<p>First, let us know the meaning of the word “Jai Shri Ram”. Jai Shri Ram means victory to Lord Shri Ram. Here Shri means Mata Sita. So Jai Shri Ram means victory to Sita Ram. “Jai” is ‘praise’. Sree or Sri denotes ‘grace’. Rama came from the root “Rema” meaning ‘happiness, contentment, the state of well being.” Rama, therefore, is the one who invoke rema and the one who invoke rema is the Self within. He is none other than YOU.</p>
<p>It is a popular slogan these days, do those who say it really appreciate what it means? When you say Jai Shri Ram you are honouring Maryada Purshottama, the ultimate man of principles. You are honouring a person who gave up his kingdom, who had no attachment to territory. You are honouring a man who gave respect to every community, every sage, the lowest and the highest, during his travels across India. You are honouring a uniter, not a divider,for whom violence was the absolute, last resort.</p>
